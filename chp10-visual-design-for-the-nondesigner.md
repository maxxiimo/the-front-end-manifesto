Visual Design for the Nondesigner
=================================

In the [last chapter][Chapter 9] our focus was Information Architecture, and in that chapter I emphasized storytelling while purposefully deemphasizing design. Here is why:

> Firstly, think about what your pages do, not what they look like. Let your design flow from the services which they will provide to your users, rather than from some overarching idea of what you want pages to look like. Let form follow function, rather than trying to take a particular design and make it "work".

\- [A Dao of Web Design][Dao] by John Allsopp

[Design is part of storytelling][Story Design] and like blocks of information in the previous chapter, the visual design must also communicate the websites story, and do so in such a way that the user just gets it.

The combination of typography, color, branding, images, and icons will help communicate a storyline, and are a major contributor to a sites look and feel. We will explore each of these elements in this chapter, but first let me make an observation relevant to your role as a front end engineer and design.

Paradigm Shift
--------------

Over the last several years I've noticed a paradigm shift in the role that front end engineers play in the design process. Back in the day for really great design you absolutely needed a Graphic Designer; unless you could work Adobe Photoshop or Adobe Illustrator like there was no tomorrow. Graphic Designers were the ones who produced rounded corners, cool fonts, gradients, translucent images, buttons, icons, icon sprites, etc.. In addition to required design elements, Graphic Designers created visual mockups of a website that non-coding stakeholders could "touch and feel", i.e. actually see and understand.

Discussion and changes could be made around these mockups before any engineering costs were incurred, it was more efficient. As a result decision-makers would gravitate towards brainstorming on usability, architecting, and design aspects of a project at the graphic design phase in the development process: that began and oftentimes ended before front end engineers were really involved.

Back then that kind of made sense, it was a simpler world, one design could almost fit all, and most things that happened in the browser could be replicated in a mockup, and so front end developers found the bulk of their contribution to a project in implementing completed mockups. They understood what kind of code the backend team needed and how they would use it, and they had the skills necessary to turn graphic design into pixel perfect – the standard of excellence back then – cross browser friendly code.

NOTE: Chapter 11, [Slicing and Dicing Mockups][Chapter 13], will dive into the mechanics of doing exactly that.

Fast-forward to today and everything has changed:

- HTML5 and CSS3 have made it possible – preferable – to produce design elements directly in the browser.
- It is increasingly more efficient to produce dynamic and responsive prototypes with the benefits of CSS3, rather than static mockups.
- Much of what is happening on the front end cannot be easily replicated in a static mockup.
- Prototyping by nature is more representative of how a webpage will ultimately look and behave across different devices.
- Prototyping allows for a more rapid, iterative, interactive, and agile design process.
- One size no longer fits all. Technologies and devices are rapidly changing. Understanding the resulting capabilities and/or limitations of browsers and devices used by end-users in a constantly evolving landscape is a necessity, not a luxury, and an area of expertise belonging to front end engineers.

As a result of these changes; usability, architecting and design decisions are beginning to convalesce around the point in which front end code is written, prototyping, as opposed to around graphic design mockups. In the very least, the absence of front end developers in the design process is no longer an option.

The takeaway in relation to this chapter is that as front end engineers we need to understand that our roles are changing. With the abilities of CSS3,think of yourself as artists of a new age; you are the handshake between design and backend engineering and can work in either realm. With this new role, in addition to coding prowess, understanding the elements of a good design, the art, is essential to the success of projects you will participate in.

The next two chapters are written to help developers along this path, but before leaving the section let me leave you with one final thought: never undervalue the hard earned design talents of graphic designers. Beautiful design is not easy.

Other Resources
---------------

What follows are some ideas and resources to help you create your site's look and feel:

- Use a framework. We listed several frameworks you can use in the [Frameworks][Appendix 1] section of the Appendices.

- Reverse engineer pieces of things you already like.

- Hire a graphic designer. With your layout set via our wireframe work half of the designers work is done. Now he or she needs to pull it all together with a stellar look and feel. When hiring a designer, make sure you let them know that the layout you have in place is not set in stone. This way your designer can add their experience to the project. Here are some resources for finding graphic designers:

  - XXX

- Get a freebie and port it over to your application.

  - [Premium Pixels][]

- Buy a template. Templates are significantly less expensive than hiring a graphic designer. As a front end coder implementing them into your layout should be a breeze. Here are some template resources:

  - XXX

- Read a tutorial.
