### Frameworks

In so far as responsive frameworks go, the following article gives you a nice comparison:

- [Responsive CSS Framework Comparison][Framework Comparison]

Here is a brief framework roundup worth taking a look at for your project.

#### Twitter Bootstrap

I like [Twitter Bootstrap][]. It's a great place to learn about best practices for any application or framework, and you can get some amazing designs in absolutely no time. It's well-documented, but here's the problem: it's built on [Less][], and use it and your site will look pretty much like everyone else's. Of course you can override styles, but I'm just sayin'.

> Sleek, intuitive, and powerful front-end framework for faster and easier web development.

Getting it to work with Rails is not impossible, hardly, but if you go this path there are some choices to consider:

- [Twitter Bootstrap, Less, and Sass: Understanding Your Options for Rails 3.1][Options]

#### Blueprint

[Blueprint][], in my opinion, is the granddaddy of all frameworks. I used to use Blueprint all of the time, and Compass makes it readily available. It's tried-and-true, and a good choice, but I rarely use it these days. I'm not too crazy about it's look and feel. It does seem to be more of a minimalist framework - which is not a bad thing.

> Blueprint is a CSS framework, which aims to cut down on your development time. It gives you a solid foundation to build your project on top of, with an easy-to-use grid, sensible typography, useful plugins, and even a stylesheet for printing.

#### YUI

 I've used YUI and personally I'm not too crazy about its grid system which is a pretty major component to any framework - so I generally stay away.

> YUI is a free, open source JavaScript and CSS library for building richly interactive web applications.
\- [YUI website][]

#### Foundation 3

I haven't used Foundation, but I'm interested.

> The most advanced responsive front-end framework in the world.
\- [Zurb website][]

#### Skeleton

I also haven't use Skeleton, but soon enough.

> A Beautiful Boilerplate for Responsive, Mobile-Friendly Development
\- [Skeleton website][]

### Grid Systems

You just can't believe how many grid system there are out there so here is a roundup for you to choose from (in alphabetical order):

1.  [320 and Up][]

    > ‘320 and Up’ is a lightweight, easy to use and content first responsive web design boilerplate.

2.  [34Grid][]

    > 34Grid is a Responsive Grid System based on "equally distributed columns" layout basis. In contrast to other great grid systems (@see bottom of page), 34Grid provides equally distributed columns for each row. (and also column complements for inequal distributions)

3.  [960 Grid System][]

    > The 960 Grid System is an effort to streamline web development workflow by providing commonly used dimensions, based on a width of 960 pixels. There are two variants: 12 and 16 columns, which can be used separately or in tandem.

4.  [Columnal][]

    > The Columnal CSS grid system is a “remix” of a couple others with some custom code thrown in. The elastic grid system is borrowed from cssgrid.net, while some code inspiration (and the idea for subcolumns) are taken from 960.gs.

5.  [Frameless][]

    > Dig responsive design? Hate fluid grids? Try a Frameless grid.

6.  [Golden Grid System ][]

    > A folding grid for responsive design.

7.  [Fluid Baseline Grid System][]

    > The FBG system was built with typographic standards in mind and combines principals of fluid-column layouts, baseline grids and mobile-first responsive design into a resolution independent and device agnostic framework.

8.  [Responsive GS][]

    > Fluid grid CSS framework for fast, intuitive development of responsive websites. Available in 12, 16 and 24 columns with media queries for all standard devices, clearfix, and optional reset.

9.  [Responsive Grid System][]

    > The Responsive Grid System isn't a framework. It's not a boilerplate either. It's a quick, easy & flexible way to create a responsive web site.

10. [rwdgrid][]

    > rwdgrid is just another Grid system based on popular 960grid , which is responsive and ranges from mobile, tablet, laptops and wide screen displays.

11. [SimpleGrid][]

    > Responsive. Infinite nesting. One class per element. Simple.

12. [1140 CSS Grid][]

    > The 1140 grid fits perfectly into a 1280 monitor. On smaller monitors it becomes fluid and adapts to the width of the browser.

13. [Gridiculous][]

    > Gridiculous was created after I tried out a bunch of different responsive grids and realized that none of them offered all of the features I required. First and foremost, I wanted to make sure that the grid would work from a large desktop monitor through to a tablet and all the way down to a mobile phone. That's why Gridiculous starts off at 1200px and works itself down to 320px.

### Mobile Solutions Roundup

To get started, if you're not sure where to begin or as a review, take a look at this round up of mobile solutions:

1.  The tutorial "[How to Build a Mobile Rails 3.1 App][How to Build]" demonstrates -- although slightly dated from the gem -- how to use the authors [mobylette][] and [jquery_mobile_rails][] gems. Mobylette handles requests and allows your controller to respond with a :mobile format, while jquery-mobile-rails adds [jQuery Mobile][] files to your asset pipeline: which helps make everything look great and work like a native mobile app.

2.  Much like mobylette, [mobile-fu][] detects mobile requests and allows your application to respond with a :mobile format.

3.  There is a rack-based detection solution called [mobvious][]:

    > Mobvious detects whether your app / website is being accessed by a phone, or by a tablet, or by a personal computer. You can then use this information throughout your app. (E.g. fork your front-end code with regard to device type. There is a [plugin][mobvious-rails] for Ruby on Rails that helps you with this.)

    The [mobvious-rails][] gem allows you to:

    > Access detected device type easily from controllers and views.<br>
    > Execute code for given device types only. Both in controllers and views.<br>
    > Do the above stuff also in your CoffeeScript.

4.  Ryan Bates screencast "[Mobile Devices][]" will teach you how to roll your own user agent detector.

5.  In the tutorial "[Mobile Devices and Rails: Maintaining your Sanity][Maintain Sanity]" the author proposes placing mobile templates in a separate directory, then when requests come in from a mobile subdomain, like m.domain.com, these templates are served. If the templates are not available, the requester is served regular view templates; freeing you up from having to create two templates for every action. Users can switch between the two templates, and user agent detection is employed.

6.  If you're looking to beef up your detection capabilities, the following services are available (includes free and paid plans).
    - [Handset Detection][]
    - [Akamai][]
    - [DeviceAtlas][]
    - [scientiamobile][]

7.  You can also tap into the [WURFL][] database.

8.  Here is a list of "[Mobile Browser ID (User-Agent) Strings][Mobile Strings]" you could incorporate into your project if you wanted to get granular.

### Mobylette and jQuery Mobile

One of the quickest and simplest solutions to deliver mobile views is Tiago Scolari's [mobylette][] gem with [jQuery Mobile][jQuery Mobile Home] for our user interface. Here are the steps you will follow to implement this solution:

**Step 1:** Copy all the [base-mobile][] files from the default folder followed by the mobylette folder, and place them into their corresponding directories, i.e. *stylesheets/mobile* files go in *stylesheets/mobile* in your application.

**Step 2:** Add the following to your *application.rb* file:

    # Precompile *all* assets, except those that start with underscore per:
    # http://blog.55minutes.com/2012/01/getting-compass-to-work-with-rails-31-and-32/
    config.assets.precompile << /(^[^_\/]|\/[^_])[^\/]*$/

\- [Getting Compass to Work With Rails 3.1 (and 3.2)][Get Compass to Work]

**Step 3:** Add the following gem to your *Gemfile* and then bundle install:

    gem 'mobylette'

**Step 4:** Add the following to *application_controller.rb*:

    include Mobylette::RespondToMobileRequests
    mobylette_config do |config|
      config[:skip_xhr_requests] = false
    end

**Step 5:** Add the following to *config/environments/production.rb*:

    # Precompile additional assets (application.js, application.css, and all non-JS/CSS are already added)
    config.assets.precompile += %w( modernizr-2.6.2.min.js, jquery.mobile-1.2.0.css )

And that's it!

One thing that you may have noticed is that there certainly does seem to be a lot of repetition in our code, two files for almost everything. One of the key arguments for Responsive Web Design is the elimination of duplication.

Here you will find recommendations for:

1.  Font stacks that you can copy and use in your project.

2.  Web safe fonts, i.e. fonts that are most common on most versions of Windows, Mac, and Linux.

    You can copy these and feel confident using them as your overall default font stack, or as a fallback font stack for a more interesting typeface.

3.  Typefaces that go well together, say one font for your headers and another contrasting font for your body.

4.  Mobile fonts.

5.  Font classifications and definitions.

### Font Stack Roundup

5.  *03/19/12* - [Complete Guide to Pre-Installed Fonts in Linux, Mac, and Windows][Complete Guide]

    > Web fonts are gaining in popularity now, but they can still be a bit of a challenge to use.

### Choosing Typefaces

The following is designed to help you choose your typefaces. Here are some articles, and an excellent transcript from a presentation by Jason Santa Maria.

#### Choosing Typeface Articles

2.  *08/25/11* - [A Brief Primer on Typeface Selection][Brief Primer]

3.  *12/01/11* - [6 Questions You Should Ask Yourself When Choosing Fonts][6 Questions]

4.  *09/26/12* - [Make a Statement with Type][Type Statement]

Mobile

5.  *10/02/11* - [5 Tips for Excellent Mobile Typography][5 Tips]

6.  *11/12/12* - [Mobile Design Typography is Vitally Important ... and Challenging][Mobile typography]

#### Jason Santa Maria On Web Typography

Jason Santa Maria, in a presentation at [Build 2011][] called [On Web Typography][] spoke about picking typefaces. I've transcribed it here in part and slightly paraphrased:

1.  Questions to ask yourself: What are you using it for? How will it be used? Under what conditions? From the slide "considerations":

    > **Dimensions**
    > Are there requirements for how much text must fit in a given region?

    > **Special Features** - Do you require special features your typefaces
    > What features do you require? Multiple weights, lining &amp; old-style figures, small caps, etc?

    > **Prolonged Reading** -
    > Is this a book or a long format periodical?

    > **Internationalization** -
    > Does a given font support all the special characters of the language to be used?


2.  Readability and distinctness in characters matters. Will the typeface cause the reader to become confused, or tired of reading it?

3.  Avoid readymades. Fonts with design baked in.

4.  Develop your own personal palette. Find typefaces that you like, that you gravitate to, and keep using them. Get to know a typeface.

5.  Get to know the history of a typeface. When was it designed? Why was it designed? This should complement not contradict your text/subject.

6.  Find typefaces that embody a mental association: terms you want to associate with the design.

7.  Pair fonts that are designed together, they will work well together. The serif for the body text, the sans serif for the supplementary stuff like page numbers and captions.

8.  Use alternatives for commonly used typefaces get the same type of feel without being the same as everyone else. For example Helvetica. You can use an alternative rather than the frequently used Helvetica itself: FF Dagny, Proxima Nova, Museo Sans, Prehematica Slabserif.

9.  Try it out! Test out your ideas. See how it looks. See how it reads. See how it feels. In long-form text, in short-form text. Small columns, wide columns. Big text, small text. Doing this gives you a very real impression on how other people are going to see it.
