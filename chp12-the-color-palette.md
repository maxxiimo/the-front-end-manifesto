The Color Palette
=================

> There are many contributing factors that go into making a good visual design, but one of the simplest ways to do this is through the use of colour. The colour palette used in a design can have such a profound effect on a visual design that it almost feels like you’re cheating. It’s easy to add more and more subtle shades of colour to add a sense of sophistication and complexity to a design, but it dilutes the overall visual impact. When I design, I almost have a rule that only allows me to use a very limited colour palette.

\- Mike Kus, "[Nine Things I've Learned][9 Things]"

So how do we begin to develop our own color palette? First, some background (for your reference). The following articles do an excellent job of defining the fundamentals of color theory, and the basic steps and components in building a color scheme:

- [Build a Color Scheme: The Fundamentals][Color Fundamentals]
- [Basic color schemes - Introduction to Color Theory][Color Theory]
- [Color Matters - Basic Color Theory][Color Matters]

The basic steps and components include:

1.  Selecting a base color while taking into account the effect colors have on our perceptions and feelings.
2.  Choosing color harmonies from the color wheel, i.e. what colors will work well together.
3.  Selecting the right tones, shades and tints for each color in the color scheme.

...But practically speaking, how do you begin?

Step 1: Pick a Color
--------------------

The first step in creating a color palette is to choose a base color. If you already have a logo to work with, the colors in the logo are good place to start from. Since I don't have a logo yet I'm going to borrow from a technique we used in the Font Family section of [Chapter 11][Adjectives]. Here is the list of adjectives used to choose a typeface:

1.  Clean
2.  Reliable
3.  Artistic
4.  Appealing
5.  Youthful
6.  Competent
7.  Knowledgeable
8.  Trustworthy
9.  Cutting Edge
10. Innovative
11. Fun
12. Steadfast
13. Friendly

Are there any colors that may help convey this? Reviewing the color descriptions in the following references:

- [The Meanings of Colors][] (MoC)
- [Build a Color Scheme: The Fundamentals][Color Fundamentals] (BaCS)
- [Color in Motion][] (CiM)

...I do come up with a few:

- **White** - This makes a lot of sense to me since we start our adjectives list with the word "Clean".

  > A white color scheme can represent cleanliness, purity, perfection and space...If you are looking for a clean design with plenty of negative space, play around with white more. - BaCS

- **Red** - As an overall base color I'm not sold on it for my purposes, but I do have some callout buttons so will keep this color in mind if it fits in my color wheel choice.

  > A red color scheme is bold, fiery, aggressive and screams for your attention...Red is a really powerful marketing color that can be used to grab the user’s attention and get them to click on an ad or register for a product. - BaCS

  > Red is the color of extremes. It’s the color of passionate love, seduction, violence, danger, anger, and adventure...Red captures attention. It is one of the most visible colors, second only to yellow... - MoC

  > Dynamic, vital, romantic, commanding, alert, rebellious, complementary, joyful, visible, hot, and fun. - CiM

- **Orange** - This might be the one. Aside from the fact that the parent company of View Thought uses it, it's feel seems to touch on a lot of the adjectives I have listed, plus it could be an alternative to red for callouts.

  > An orange color scheme speaks happiness...Orange is a very friendly color, a warm color that is inviting and can be another very effective color for call-to-actions. - BaCS

  > Orange is vibrant. It’s hot, healthy, fruity and engaging – but it can be abrasive and crass. It’s a polarizing color. People either love it or detest it. - MoC

  > Helpful, burning, cozy, abundant, warning, flavorful, festive, active, excited, communicative, and inspiring. - CiM

- **Green** - I'm liking this one insofar as it touches on trust and stability.

  > A green color scheme is peaceful and natural and is usually associated with growth, harmony, peace, strength and stability....it portrays a feeling of safety and trust... - BaCS

  > Green is no longer just a color. It's now the symbol of ecology and a verb. - MoC

  > Patient, natural, adventurous, relaxed, athletic, unfortunate, lucky, balanced, safe, and sharing. - CiM

- **Blue** - Well if this isn't the cats meow.

  > Blue means stability and depth and is a great color for creating a calm clean environment. Blue symbolizes confidence, faith, hope, wisdom, knowledge and trust. - BaCS

  > Blue is the favorite color of all people...Most blues convey a sense of trust, loyalty, cleanliness, and understanding. On the other hand, blue evolved as symbol of depression in American culture...Blue is the most commonly used color in corporate identity. - MoC

  > Technical, deep, free, educated, protective, lonely, peaceful, cold, clean, authoritative, and formal. - CiM

- **Yellow** - Creative is good, so is young, but coward... not liking that.

  > Creative, young, visible, right, cheerful, lightweight, curious, coward, playful, nutritious, ill, and expanding. - CiM

- **Purple** - Not quite the look I'm looking for.

  > Intelligent, artistic, aloof, luxurious, loyal, vain, fantastic, melancholic, feminine, fragrant, and solemn. - CiM

So based on this preliminary research, white, orange and blue are looking like very strong candidates for View Thought's color palette.

Once you have an idea about the colors you want to use, find their hex values. I like to use the tool [0to255][]. It gives you a lot of options in terms of shades. [216 Web Safe Colors][Web Safe] Possible candidate hex values for View Thought are:

- White: #ffffff
- Orange: #eb7e28

  ![][Orange]

  Or perhaps the parent companies shhade of orange: #f69233

- Blue: #4b99f9

  ![][Blue]

Let's bring these colors over to the color wheel.

Step 2: Use the Color Wheel
---------------------------

> The human brain will reject under-stimulating information. At the other extreme is a visual experience that is so overdone, so chaotic that the viewer can't stand to look at it. The human brain rejects what it can not organize, what it can not understand. The visual task requires that we present a logical structure. Color harmony delivers visual interest and a sense of order.

\- [Color Matters - Basic Color Theory][Color Matters]

The color wheel is the basis from which our color choices will flow. It will help us find color harmonies based on color theory. It's important to get to know this tool.
<br>

![][Color Wheel]

Fortunately for us, there are a number of online color wheels we can use. There is a list of them in the [Color Wheels][] section of Appendix 12, but before we use one familiarize yourself with the different ways you can derive colors on the color wheel:

- [Analogous][]
- [Complementary][]
- [Triadic][]
- [Split-Complementary][]
- [Rectangle (Tetradic)][]
- [Square][]
- Monochromatic

I like to play around with a couple different color wheels:

- [Adobe Kuler][]

  ![][Kuler]

- [Color Wizard][]

  ![][Wizard]

With these tools you have a lot of color harmonies to play with.

Step 3: Look at Alternatives
----------------------------

It's a good idea not to rely solely on the color wheel.

#### Find different shades of a color...

For example, there's a tool I like to use for finding different shades of a color:

- [Color Palette Creator][Palette Creator]

  ![][Shades]

#### Generated a color palette from an image...

I've also been considering using a hero image on our homepage. A color palette that matches that hero image might not be a bad idea. There are a [number of tools][] that will create a color palette based off of an image:

- [Color Palette Generator][]

  ![][Generator]

- [Pictaculous][]

  ![][Pictaculous Image]

#### Browse a color palette sharing service...

Finally, look at [color palettes created by the design community][Palettes]. You never know what you will find or be inspired by. Here are some of the palettes I have added to a "My Favorites" list in my favorite palette sharing service:

- [Adobe Kuler][Kuler]

  ![][Favorites]

I'm strongly considering the following palettes:

- https://kuler.adobe.com/Copy-of-Flat-UI-color-theme-2585872/

  ![][Palette 1]

- https://kuler.adobe.com/Black-%26-Orange-color-theme-2251290/

  ![][Palette 2]

- https://kuler.adobe.com/Nakamoto-color-theme-2532500/

  ![][Palette 3]

The last palette is a good example of finding inspiration from community palettes. Green was not at the top of my list, although I liked it.

Step 4: Apply
-------------

> With colors you can set a mood, attract attention, or make a statement. You can use color to energize, or to cool down. By selecting the right color scheme, you can create an ambiance of elegance, warmth or tranquility, or you can convey an image of playful youthfulness. Color can be your most powerful design element if you learn to use it effectively.

\- [Basic color schemes - Introduction to Color Theory][Color Theory]

Like selecting a typeface, applying a color palette is a practice in trial and error. Before you begin, it's helpful to revisit the [Inspirational Sites][] appendix. Design is super difficult, so don't get frustrated,, just keep plugging away and experimenting.

I like to create different renditions of my color experimentation in different branches. It's okay to move your information blocks around, even reinvent the flow.

After some heavy experimentation here are two ideas I came up with:
